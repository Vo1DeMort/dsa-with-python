# Type	                   Description
# Full Binary Tree	       Every node has 0 or 2 children
# Perfect Binary Tree	   All levels are filled completely
# Complete Binary Tree	   All levels are filled, last level is filled from left
# Balanced Tree	           Left and right subtreesâ€™ height differ by at most 1
# Binary Search Tree(BST)  Left child < node < right child
