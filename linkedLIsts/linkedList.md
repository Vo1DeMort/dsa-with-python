# a data structure where the data elements are stored in a linear order
- efficient storage of data in linear through pointer structures

# array
- elements are stored in contiguous memory location
# list
- elements are stored in different memory location
# linked list
- elements are stored sequentially and connected through pointers

## node
- data 
- pointer
