### An algorithm can be converted into computer software
### using any programming language

### the performance or efficiency of the computer program also
### depends highly on how the data is stored in the memory of a
### computer which is going to be used in the algorithm

# in python type can be checked with ,type()

# python is a very convenient to learn and understand the concepts of data structures and algorithm 


## efficient mechanism to store, manage and retrieve data
- data structure

## efficient algorithm to solve the problem 

## performance of an algorithm is measured by 
- size of input data n
- time and memory space used by the algorithm

# time complexity
- amount of time required to execute on a computer system

# the worst-case running time (upper bound ,O notation)
# the average-case running time 
# best-case running time (lower bound)

# space complexity
- memory requirement

# big O notation denotes the worst-case running time complexity
