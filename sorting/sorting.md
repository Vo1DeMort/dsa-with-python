## arranging items in a list ascending or descending order

# bubble sort
- compare two items, and another pair and so on in each iteration

# insertion sort
- maintain two sublists
- one is sorted and one is not
- elements are added one by one from the unsorted one to sorted one
- similar to how humans do


# selection sort
- find the smallest element in the list and exchange it with the data stored at the first position in the list  and so on

# quick sort
- pick an element(pivot) and compare to the rest and sort
- swap left(got this when pivot is bigger) and right pointer(got this when pivot is smaller)
- and repeat

# timsort (default sorting in python)
- combination of merge sort and insertion sort
- use insertion first and then merge

# merge sort (chap 3)
- don't really understand this

# it would be easier learn with visuals(video)
