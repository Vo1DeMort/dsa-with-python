# tree-based data structure
- each node of the tree has a specific relationship with other nodes, stored in a specific order
- can be max heap or min heap

# max heap
- parent node  >= children nodes  
- root node must be the greatest value in the tree

# min heap
- parent node <= children nodes
- root node holds the lowest value

# heap can be any kind of tree,however the most common one is binary heap
